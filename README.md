# Portals ID

## Benefits

The benefits of a Portals ID are two-fold.

1. One it allows you to reserve a "handle" in Portals.  No one else will be able to use your Portals ID handle except you.
2. The same Portals ID allows you to assign a custom URL slug to your space. &#x20;

* This is done by going to your spaces: [https://theportal.to/dashboard/my-spaces](https://theportal.to/dashboard/my-spaces)
* Hover over the space tile and click on the gear icon of the space you want to assign the slug to.
* Pick your Portals ID

You can access your Portals space by using the following convention:

https://theportal.to/s/\<Space Slug>

## Selling

If you decide that you ever don't want your Portals ID anymore, you can redeem it back for the ORIGINAL purchase value.  If you bought the Portals ID on secondary from someone else for a different price, that price is not honored, only the original purchase price.

From the Portals ID screen, click on "Redeem" (upper left-hand corner).

You can then select which Portals ID you wish to "burn" for the original price.  This then makes it available to someone else to buy.
